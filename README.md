Your Challenge

Your challenge will be to write a webpage that uses API to retrieve weather information from an external source. To do this, you will create the user interface, send the request to the external source using JavaScript, process data received and present the information on your webpage using HTML.

In this project, we'll use 7Timer API, which is free of charge and does not require any API keys.

After you complete your project, you will share your webpage.
